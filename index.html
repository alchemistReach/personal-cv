      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <div class="profile-description">
        <p>I go by Software Developer, Project Manager, Servant Leader, and a few other titles but essentially, I like building cool stuff with cool people. I'm also the founder and owner of Inside Horizon Group, a holding company for real estate, financial assets, and small businesses.
          I like the simple things in life: a good cup of coffee, a cold ale, and the company of family and friends.</p>

        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p class="skills-p">I started programming a little later than most, really in my early 20s. What initially started as developing Python scripts for quantitative analysis and data
          modeling around financial markets turned into full stack web development for B2C and B2B online services. I also have experience in C++ firmware development for robotic automation,
          though my passion is more software focused.</p>

        <h3>Agile Project Management</h3>
        <p class="skills-p">I got my first taste of project management in the Philippines when I spearheaded a water filtration project in the middle of the jungle on Mindanao. I quickly realized
        that I was pretty good at organizing teams of people and resources and developing roadmaps to achieve larger objectives. This transitioned into automotive electronics and software development.
        I learned of Agile from experiencing the shortcomings of the waterfall methodology and wish I would've learned it sooner. As a Professional Scrum Master, I have not only the practical hands-on
        experience but understand the framework to deploy it at scale when needed. I've managed million dollar budgets and negotiated terms for $10s of millions worth of business, leveraging technical and commercial
        factors to secure and deliver value to company and ultimately clients. I'm also pretty awesome at creating product evangelists within client organizations.</p>

        <h3>Technical Program Management</h3>
        <p class="skills-p">I have experience in defining multiple projects and initiatives with the aim of meeting larger organizational goals to improve the business. The majority of this experience comes from
          a startup environment, where processes are initially non-existent and strong leadership is necessary. Understanding what's needed from design to deployment and helping organize the right people for
          the job is what I'm great at. <span class="italicize">Baptism by fire</span> is an expression I've come to experience many times over.</p>
